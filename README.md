# Abstract
We report on the development of neural networks for generating readings of Telescope Array’s
surface detectors with the largest registered integral signal. To achieve this goal, we implemented
generative Waserstein adversarial networks with gradient penalty. The data used to train the model
was generated using the Monte Carlo method. We obtained visually similar data, which is consistent
with the physics of the underlying processes. The anomaly search method can be used to search for
discrepancies between real and simulated data, as well as to introduce the quantitative measure of
similarity between the real and generated by the neural network detector’s readings.
