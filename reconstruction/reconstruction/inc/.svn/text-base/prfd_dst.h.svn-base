/* Comments added 6-29-2001 lrw
 * This bank contains results of fitting shower profiles. 
 *
 * The shower profile, ie the number of particles along the shower axis,
 * is described by a 4 parameter function.  As of 6-29-01, the function is
 * a Gieser-Hillas function. The four parameters are
 * szmx, xm, x0, lambda.  These are described later.  From these the shower energy,
 * eng, is estimated.
 * Each parameter is actually a 1 dimensional array.
 * For stereo analysis an index of 0 indicates the measurement was
 * made by HiRes1 (for example prfd_.eng[0] ), and index of 1 indicates the 
 * measurement wsa made by HiRes2.  Higher indicies correspond to other fit
 * that may or not be filled depending on the program used to fill this bank.
 * As of 6-29-01, these profiles 0,1 were determined independently at each site using
 * a geometry determined a stereo fit. 
 *
 * Also provided is the profile of light along the shower axis
 * that would correspond to the profile of light measured by the detector.
 * The light profile measured by the detector is not in this bank.  It is
 * typically found in the hcbin bank.
 * Note that the profile of light at the shower and the profile of light at the
 * detector are very different, due primarily to geometrical and atmospheric effects!
 *
 * The light profile at the shower is separated into 4 components.  scin is the profile of
 * scintillation light, rayl the profile of cherenkov light scattered by the
 * molecular component of the atmosphere, aero the component scattered by the
 * aerosol part of the atmosphere, and crnk the direct (unscattered) part of
 * the cherenkov beam that would reach the detector.
 * The light profiles are divided into "nbin" bins.  The atmospheric depth
 * of the center of each bin is given by dep (slant grammage) and gm (vertical grammage)

   PRFD_FIT_NOT_REQUESTED  - Reserved for marking fits that user
     did not want computed, even though necessary banks may have
     been present.
   PRFD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED - Reserved for marking fits that are not
     yet implemented in the code, for example, hr1+hr2 combined
     fit or the spares. The spare fits can be handy for specialized
     code which does the same fit under different physics assumptions.
   PRFD_REQUIRED_BANKS_MISSING - Indicates that the basic banks
     required for the fit are not available or have failed. For 
     example, the hr1 fit requires BIN1, and PLN1.
   PRFD_MISSING_TRAJECTORY_INFO - Indicates that trajectory info
     is not available. It is possible that some source of trajectory
     information is available (say TIM1), but it was not the source
     the user specified.
   PRFD_UPWARD_GOING_TRACK - Indicates track was upward going. Such
     tracks are not fitted.
   PRFD_TOO_FEW_BINS - Indicates there were not enough good bins
     for the fit. Bins may be lost due to the Cherenkov cut in the
     profile fitter program or earlier during the binning process.
   PRFD_FITTER_FAILURE - Indicates the fitter failed. Usually this
     means the fitter ran to an edge, i.e. x0 went to its extreme
     negative value.
   PRFD_INSANE_TRAJECTORY - The core location and/or track direction
     is so unreasonable that the event can not be processed.

   bininfo[]  - should be set to PRFD_BININFO_USED or PRFD_BININFO_UNUSED
                depending on whether or not the fit contains profile bin
		information, i.e. the light contributions in each bin.

   mtxinfo[]  - should be set to PRFD_MTXINFO_USED or PRFD_MTXINFO_UNUSED
