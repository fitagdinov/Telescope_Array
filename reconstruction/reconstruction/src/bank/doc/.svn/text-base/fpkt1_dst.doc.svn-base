        Documentation listing packet type and 
        packet contents in raw dst files
        ----------------------------------------
Packet Format
-------------
                Each packet consists of up to 64 words. The
                first word is the header, which contains the
                packet id and the word count. The last word
                is the header word repeated. In the case of
                data packets, the penultimate word is a
                checksum consisting of the exclusive or of
                all the other words in the packet (including
                or excluding both the header and tail -- 
                figure it out.)

                The header contains a 5-bit packet id in bits
                8:C, a word count in bits 0:5, and a last
                packet flag in bit F. A single unit of
                information, for example the data from a 
                single channel for a single event, can span
                several packets. The last packet has the
                last packet flag set.

 3  Confirm     This packet is broadcast for any big
                trigger, and also read out for any
                confirmed trigger.
                Word 0 -- Header (Bit 14 set if trigger confirmed)
                Word 1 -- Mlink status word (a lot of status
                          bits, sometimes useful for debugging.
                          see mlink file lnkmem.inc for descript.)
                Word 2 -- Trigger Number:
                          bits 0:5 are the mirror ID
                          bits 8:F are an 8-bit counter,
                          kept separately for each mirror.
                Word 3 -- M2 start address: where the event
                          is stored on FADC boards.
                Word 4 -- Low 16 bits of start time (10 MHz clock)
                Word 5 -- Number of time bins stored.
                Word 6 -- Trigger code: code word read from
                          trigger PLD's on TRIG/HOST module --
                          Bits 5:8 NV -- Vertical Coincidence bits
                          Bits 9:C NH -- Horizontal Coincidences
                          Bit 0: NH > 0 & NV > 0
                          Bit 1: NH > 1 or NH > 1
                          Bit 2: NH > 1 & NV > 1
                          Bit 3: NH > 2 or NV > 2
                          Bit 4: NH > 2 & NV > 2
                          Note: Big triggers are typically defined
                          as those with bit 2,3, or 4 set. Big
                          triggers are broadcast.
                          Note: Code = FFFF is an external trigger.
                Word 7    Bits 14:29 of time of trigger
                Word 8    Bits 30:45 of time of trigger               

 4  Data/Snapshots
                Raw data is read out one slave at a time.
                The first packet is a summary of scan information
                for that slave. Subsequent packets contain the raw
                data for each channel in which a hit was found.
                In the case of snapshots (mirror id = 0 in trigger
                number) the scan summary is followed by a single
                packet per slave containing the means and variances
                for each channel, but no raw data.
                In the case of bigshots (mirror id = 63 in trigger
                number) the full raw data is read out for each
                channel regardless of whether a hit is found.
